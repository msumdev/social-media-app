# Just a Social Media Application

The motivation for starting this project is that I'm done with social media. I do not believe it creates a good environment and I do not think that being social is the primary objective. Modern social media applications such as Facebook and Instagram are just used by people as a means to waste their time through shorts or to get a bunch of likes on pictures.

I want social media to encourage the social part, something that should be important. Meet new people, speak about different things. Share your life, build a life. Social first.
